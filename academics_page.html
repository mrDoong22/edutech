				<h3>ELA</h3>
				<p>In 3rd grade ELA, students are expected to develop their <strong>reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language skills</strong>. One of the primary areas of focus in reading is the ability to <strong>identify key ideas and details</strong> in a text. This means that students should be able to determine the main idea of a text, ask and answer questions about the text, and identify important details. They should also be able to <strong>use text evidence to support their answers</strong>.
				</p><p>
				Another area of focus is <strong>reading fluency</strong>, which refers to the ability to read smoothly, accurately, and with expression. Students should be able to read aloud with confidence and use appropriate phrasing, tone, and inflection. They should also be able to <strong>read grade-level texts with accuracy and comprehension</strong>.
				</p><p>
				In writing, students are expected to develop their skills in various types of writing, including <strong>narratives, informative and explanatory writing, and opinion writing</strong>. They should be able to plan and revise their writing, use appropriate language conventions, and produce clear and coherent writing that is appropriate for their audience.
				</p><p>
				In speaking and listening, students should be able to communicate effectively and actively listen to others. This includes being able to speak clearly and confidently, listen attentively to others, and participate in discussions and collaborative activities.
				</p><p>
				Finally, in language, students are expected to develop their knowledge of grammar, vocabulary, spelling, and usage. They should be able to use proper grammar and spelling in their writing and speaking, understand and use a range of vocabulary words, and use context clues to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words.
				</p>

				<h3>Math</h3>
				<p>
				In 3rd grade math, students are expected to develop their skills in several key areas. One of the primary areas of focus is <strong>arithmetic, which includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</strong> Students should be able to solve problems using these operations, and they should also be able to understand the relationship between them. Additionally, they should be able to solve problems that involve <strong>fractions</strong>, using a variety of methods and representations.
				</p><p>
				Another area of focus is measurement and data. Students should be able to <strong>measure length, weight, volume, and time using appropriate units, and they should be able to compare and estimate measurements</strong>. They should also be able to represent and interpret data using graphs, tables, and other visual representations.
				</p><p>
				Geometry is another important area of focus in 3rd grade math. Students should be able to understand the <strong>properties of two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes</strong>, including their sides, angles, and symmetry. They should also be able to partition shapes into equal parts, and to understand the relationship between <strong>area and perimeter</strong>. <br><br>

				<h3>Science</h3>
				<p>
				The <strong>Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)</strong> for 3rd grade cover a wide range of topics in the areas of <br>
				<ul>
					<li>Physical Sciences</li>
					<li> Life Sciences</li>
					<li>Earth and Space Sciences</li>
					<li>Engineering, Technology, and Applications of Science</li>
				</ul>
				</p><p>
				In <strong>Physical Sciences</strong>, 3rd graders are expected to explore properties of matter, such as size, weight, and texture. They learn how to measure and compare these properties, and identify changes in matter, such as heating and cooling. Students also explore forces and motion, including the effects of pushes and pulls on objects, and simple machines like levers and pulleys.
				</p><p>
				In <strong>Life Sciences</strong>, 3rd graders learn about the characteristics of living things, such as the need for food, water, and air, and the ability to grow and reproduce. They study different ecosystems and how organisms adapt to their environments. Students also explore the interdependence of plants and animals in ecosystems, and the role of humans in impacting ecosystems.
				</p><p>
				In <strong>Earth and Space Sciences</strong>, 3rd graders study the properties of rocks and minerals, the water cycle, and weather patterns. They explore different types of landforms and natural resources, and how these resources are used and conserved. Students also learn about the movement of the sun, moon, and stars in the sky, and the phases of the moon.
				</p><p>
				In <strong>Engineering, Technology, and Applications of Science</strong>, 3rd graders learn about the design process and how engineers use science and technology to solve problems. They explore simple machines and how they make work easier, and design and test solutions to real-world problems, such as building a structure that can withstand an earthquake.

				<h3>Music for Minors</h3>
				<p>Music for Minors (MFM) offers a comprehensive music education program for elementary school students, including 3rd graders. The program is designed to provide a well-rounded music education that includes singing, playing instruments, music theory, music history, and cultural music.
				</p>
				<p>
				For 3rd graders, MFM introduces students to different types of musical instruments and their families: <br>
				<ol>
					<li>string</li>
					<li>percussion</li>
					<li>brass</li>
					<li>woodwind</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Students learn how to read music notation, rhythm, and melody through singing and playing simple instruments like recorders, xylophones, and percussion instruments. Students also learn about different musical styles and genres from various cultures around the world.
				</p>

		<div id="cs">
				<h3>Computer Science</h3>
				<p>
				Computer Science for All (CSforAll) is a program offered by the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) that aims to provide all students with access to high-quality computer science education from elementary through high school.
				</p><p>
				In 3rd grade, the CSforAll program introduces students to fundamental computer science concepts through a variety of activities and projects. Students learn how to use technology tools, such as computers, tablets, and programming software, to create simple programs and digital content. They also learn about the basics of programming, including loops, variables, and conditional statements, using block-based programming languages like Scratch.
